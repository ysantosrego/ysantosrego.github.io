I am a _maranhense_ mathematician hailing from Upaon-AÃ§u, an island in northeastern Brazil. 
Currently, I am a Lecturer[^1] at the University of Lincoln, where I am a member of the [Charlotte Scott Research Centre for Algebra](https://algebra-lincoln.org/). 

Prior to joining the [School of Mathematics and Physics](https://www.lincoln.ac.uk/smp/) here in Lincoln, I was a _wissenschaftlicher Mitarbeiter_ in the group of [Petra Schwer](https://www.geometry.ovgu.de/) at the Otto-von-Guericke-UniversitÃ¤t Magdeburg, an associated fellow of the GRK2297 "Mathematical Complexity Reduction" ([MathCoRe](https://www.mathcore.ovgu.de/)) and a researcher in the SPP2026 "[Geometry at Infinity](https://www.spp2026.de/)".

I got my PhD from the UniversitÃ¤t Bielefeld, advised by [Kai-Uwe Bux](https://www.math.uni-bielefeld.de/~bux/). Before that I got my Master's degree from the Universidade Estadual de Campinas (Unicamp) supervised by [Dessislava Kochloukova](https://www.ime.unicamp.br/~desi/), and my Bachelor's degree from the Universidade de BrasÃ­lia (UnB). In BrasÃ­lia I was also a member of the groups [PETMat-UnB](https://mat.unb.br/pet/) and [Theory of Computation](https://mat.unb.br/~ayala/TCgroup/index.html) under the guidance of [Mauro Rabelo](https://mat.unb.br/index.php/pessoas/docentes/52-mauro-luiz-rabelo) and [MaurÃ­cio Ayala-RincÃ³n](http://www.mat.unb.br/ayala/), respectively.

Research interests
------
I am an algebraist by training but consider myself a topologist/geometer in spirit, which means I work in [group theory](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4757-4034-9#about-this-book). That is, my research concerns properties of spaces and of their symmetries (such as [reflections](https://www.mathsisfun.com/geometry/symmetry-reflection.html)). The fun part is that the term "space" can be interpreted quite broadly, from a [hairy ball](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2320587?origin=crossref&seq=2#metadata_info_tab_contents) to a comic-book-like multiverse known as [Bruhat--Tits building](https://hal.science/file/index/docid/94363/filename/_04a5_Euclidean_buildings_Grenoble_.pdf), from fundamental [geometric shapes](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/PlatonicSolid.html) to model spaces describing the [motion of a robot](https://www.ensta-bretagne.fr/jaulin/paper_cameleon.pdf).

In this area one can investigate a wide variety of problems. For example, regarding the space we could ask whether there exist serious obstructions in it (such as holes of various dimensions), whether it is curved somehow, what happens when we move "forever" (e.g., "periodically" or "towards infinity"), or whether we can describe what happens over time with an object moving in the given space under certain rules.

As for the symmetries themselves, we might want to know for instance how many there are, whether we can describe them in a simple fashion, how they transform objects in the given space, whether there are points left unchanged by the symmetries, or about the relationship between given sets of symmetries of (not necessarily distinct) spaces.

In more technical terms, my work (so far) lies in combinatorial/geometric group theory and related topics from topology. I have particular interest in cohomological and topological finiteness conditions, Reidemeister classes, and algorithmic questions. As such, I am very fond of geometric, topological, cohomological, combinatorial, and algorithmic aspects of groups and spaces on which they act.

Groups that I like include (but are not limited to) linear groups (algebraic and Lie groups, their (S-)arithmetic counterparts, Coxeter groups, ...), R. Thompson's groups and their relatives, and locally compact (including profinite) groups. In the topological realm I also enjoy things like [knots and links](https://www.ams.org/publications/journals/notices/201705/rnoti-p461.pdf) (and more generally spatial graphs) and questions about low-dimensional spaces.

As a former member of the group of Theory of Compuation in BrasÃ­lia, I am also interested in formal methods in mathematics and proof assistants. From time to time I am also puzzled by Costas arrays.
