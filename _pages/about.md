I am a _maranhense_ mathematician hailing from Upaon-AÃ§u, an island in northeastern Brazil. 
Currently, I am a Lecturer[^1] at the University of Lincoln, where I am a member of the [Charlotte Scott Research Centre for Algebra](https://algebra-lincoln.org/). 

Prior to joining the [School of Mathematics and Physics](https://www.lincoln.ac.uk/smp/) here in Lincoln, I was a _wissenschaftlicher Mitarbeiter_ in the group of [Petra Schwer](https://www.geometry.ovgu.de/) at the Otto-von-Guericke-UniversitÃ¤t Magdeburg, an associated fellow of the GRK2297 "Mathematical Complexity Reduction" ([MathCoRe](https://www.mathcore.ovgu.de/)) and a researcher in the SPP2026 "[Geometry at Infinity](https://www.spp2026.de/)".

I got my PhD from the UniversitÃ¤t Bielefeld, advised by [Kai-Uwe Bux](https://www.math.uni-bielefeld.de/~bux/). Before that I got my Master's degree from the Universidade Estadual de Campinas (Unicamp) supervised by [Dessislava Kochloukova](https://www.ime.unicamp.br/~desi/), and my Bachelor's degree from the Universidade de BrasÃ­lia (UnB). In BrasÃ­lia I was also a member of the groups [PETMat-UnB](https://mat.unb.br/pet/) and [Theory of Computation](https://mat.unb.br/~ayala/TCgroup/index.html) under the guidance of [Mauro Rabelo](https://mat.unb.br/index.php/pessoas/docentes/52-mauro-luiz-rabelo) and [MaurÃ­cio Ayala-RincÃ³n](http://www.mat.unb.br/ayala/), respectively.
