			<h1>Mini-Workshop: Trending Aspects in Group Cohomology<br>2-3 July 2024, Lincoln, UK</h1>
			
			<h2>Venue</h2>
			All talks and the coffee break will take place in room <b>INB 1103</b> in the <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/11497945">Isaac Newton Building</a> in the Brayford Campus of the University of Lincoln.

			</div>
			The Brayford Campus is located at the heart of the historic city of Lincoln, UK. The Campus is a 5min walk from the Lincoln Central Train Station. For participants intending to come by train, there are regular connections to major cities such as Nottingham, Leeds, Sheffield and London (from Kings Cross/St Pancras station). Participants travelling by bus should find regular connections to nearby major cities such as Nottingham.
			<br>
			<br>
			If you are travelling from mainland Europe, taking the Eurostar to London and then continuing by train to Lincoln might be a viable option. For those flying, the (geographically) closest airport is the East Midlands Airport (EMA), though people travelling to/from Lincoln often use larger hubs such as the airports in Manchester (MAN), Birmingham (BHX), and London (Stansted (STN), City (LCY), Heathrow (LHR), Luton (LTN), and Gatwick (LGW)).
