			<i>Finitely generated simple groups</i>
			<br>
			<br>
			A central topic in group theory is the study of finitely generated simple groups. While the finite ones are classified, we are far from a general understanding of the finitely generated infinite ones, therefore this study largely consists of understanding which kinds of properties finitely generated simple groups can have, by building examples. I will do an overview of what is known and present many open questions. Time permitting, I will touch over recent joint works with Sun, with Coulon and Ho, and with Belk, Hyde and Zaremsky.

			<i>On Cohomology of Groups</i>
			<br>
			<br>
			In this talk we will be interested in studying problems related to cohomology of groups of different flavors.
			<br>
			In the first part, we will motivate the study of cohomology of a finite \(p\)-groups over the finite field of \(p\) elements. Here, as usual, \(p\) denotes a prime number. We give its definition and a list of examples to illustrate how intrincate its computation is. The last part of the talk studies two types of problems in group cohomology: clustering finite \(p\)-groups by their cohomology algebras, and studying cohomology algebra invariants such as the Krull dimension or the depth.
			<br>
			This talk will also serve as an introduction to some results that will be studied in the minicourse of the upcoming workshop.

			<!--<i>Towards the cohomology of \(\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{Z}/p^n)\)</i>
			<br>
			<br>
			The cohomology of matrix groups with entries in fields or infinite rings is well studied. In this talk we will move to matrix entries in \(\mathbb{Z}/p^n\) for <i>n > 1</i> and study the mod <i>p</i> cohomology of the Sylow <i>p</i>-subgroups \(S_n\) of \(\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{Z}/p^n)\), presenting the results from my PhD thesis. In the first part of the talk we will explore important characteristics of \(S_n\). Then we will fix <i>p = 3</i> and work through the computation of their mod <i>3</i> cohomology by using the Lyndon-Hochschild-Serre spectral sequence. Finally there will be a short discussion about how this fits into the computation of \(H^*(\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{Z}/p^n), \mathbb{F}_p)\).-->

			<i>Minicourse: Coclass and Cohomology</i>
			<br>
			<br>
			Historically, much effort has been done in classifying finite groups, and in particular, finite \(p\)-groups. Here, as usual, \(p\) denotes a prime number. The astonishing result obtained by Leedham-Green, Newmann, McKay <i>et al.</i> provides a structural result for finite \(p\)-groups of given coclass. Here, a finite \(p\)-group of size \(p^n\) and nilpotency class \(c\) has coclass \(n-c\).
			<br>
			In this course, we introduce finite \(p\)-groups and infinite pro-\(p\) groups of finite coclass so that we can state and understand the Structure Theorem by Leedham-Green. Using this result, we will show the key steps to (partially) prove a conjecture by J. F. Carlson: for a fixed prime number \(p\) and integer number \(r\), there are only finitely many isomorphism types of mod-\(p\) cohomology algebras for all finite \(p\)-groups of coclass \(r\). As we will show, the proof is strongly based on the realization of the cohomology of finite abelian \(p\)-groups.
			<br>
			For those that are not familiar with cohomology, it is convenient to attend the general audience talk of the LMS Midlands Regional Meeting 2025.

			<i>Conjugacy separability growth</i>
			<br>
			<br>
			The conjugacy separability growth function measures how easily one can separate conjugacy classes in finite quotients. This function is easily seen to relate to the residual finiteness growth (which measures how easily one can separate elements in finite quotients), or to the complexity of the conjugacy problem. In both cases the conjugacy separability function gives rise to upper bounds. However, this is a one-way correspondence. Looking at word and conjugacy problems of finite alternating groups, we can construct infinite groups where residual finiteness growth and conjugacy separability growth are controlled independently.

			<i>Sylow restriction in the representation theory of finite groups</i>
			<br>
			<br>
			One of the central themes in the representation theory of finite groups is to understand the relationship between the characters of a finite group \(G\) and those of its local subgroups. In particular, Sylow branching coefficients describe how an irreducible character of \(G\) decomposes upon restriction to a Sylow subgroup of \(G\). In this talk, we will discuss some of their connections to broader group-theoretic questions, before presenting new results in the case of symmetric groups in joint work with E. Giannelli.

			<i>On a generalisation of Tate cohomology</i>
			<br>
			<br>
			Tate cohomology has been generalised from finite groups to all groups by several authors using different constructions. Therefore, a uniform theory is needed explaining why their approaches all lead to the same conclusions. The goal of the talk is to provide a rough sketch of such a uniform and general theory. After highlighting to which settings this theory applies, the talk concludes by stating two fundamental properties of the resulting generalisation of Tate cohomology.

			<i>Gorenstein analogues of a projectivity criterion over group algebras</i>
			<br>
			<br>
			I will talk about a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00868">recent preprint</a> (joint with Dimitra-Dionysia Stergiopoulou) where we formulated and answered Gorenstein projective, flat, and injective analogues of a classical projectivity question for group rings under some mild additional assumptions. Although the original question, that was proposed by Jang-Hyun Jo in 2007, was for integral group rings, in our paper, we dealt with more general commutative base rings. We made use of the developments that have happened in the field of Gorenstein homological algebra over group rings in recent years, and we managed to improve and generalize several existing results from this area along the way.

			<i>Homological finiteness condition for TDLC groups</i>
			<br>
			<br>
			Gedrich and Gruenberg (1987) introduced invariants of a ring: SILP, the supremum of the injective lengths of the projectives, and SPLI, the supremum of the projective lengths of the injectives. Particularly, they showed that given a suitable commutative ring and group, if SPLI is finite, then SILP is also finite. Emmanouil (2010) extends the result and shows that for any group, SILP and SPLI are equal over the integers. This talk will explore the development of an analogous theory for the category of totally disconnected locally compact groups and discuss whether projective and injective modules are really dual.
