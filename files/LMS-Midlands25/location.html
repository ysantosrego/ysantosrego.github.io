			<h1>LMS Midlands Regional Meeting & Workshop 2025<br>Groups in the Midlands<br>17-20 June 2025, Lincoln, UK</h1>
			
			<h2>Venue</h2>
			The event will take place on the Brayford Campus of the University of Lincoln. 
			<br>
			On the first day (Tuesday, 17 June), all talks of the LMS Midlands Regional Meeting (including Society Business) are taking place in the <b>main Lecture Hall INB0114</b> of the <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/11497945">Isaac Newton Building</a>, found on the <b>Ground Floor</b>. When entering the building from its main entrance (near the Pond), head to the right past the Theorem Caf√© to find the entrance to INB0114 to your left. 
			<br>
			<br>
			Afterwards, the Reception will take place on the First Floor in room <b>INB 1103</b>, also in the <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/11497945">Isaac Newton Building</a>. To find this room: from the main entrance, one can take the stairs right across the entrance and then turn back towards the science arcade and video games collection, and walk past them -- INB1103 can be accessed through the second or third doors to the left. Alternatively, to the right of said staircase there is a door that takes you to another staircase but also to the main (heavy-duty) lift of the building. Taking the lift to the first floor, exit and go to your right through the doors, then looking to the right you shall see the science arcade and video games collection.
			<br>
			<br>
			Society Dinner on Tuesday evening will take place at the <a href="https://cosyclub.co.uk/location/lincoln/">Cosy Club Lincoln</a> at the Cornhill Quarter, hence a few meters away from Lincoln Central Station.
			<br>
			<br>
			On the second day (Wednesday, 18 June), the Workshop kicks off right across the Pond in the <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/1214298650">Ross Lucas Medical Sciences Building</a> (known to local non-mathematicians as "LMS"), in Lecture Room <b>LMS0005</b> on the Ground Floor. The room's sign is easy to spot upon entering the building through the main entrance. All talks of the second day are held there.
			<br>
			<br>
			For the final two days (Thursday 19 and Friday 20), we return to the <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/11497945">Isaac Newton Building</a> to have all talks in room <b>INB 1103</b>, where we had the Reception.

			<h2>Access</h2>
			The Brayford Campus has step-free entrances to all main buildings, include the two (INB and LMS) of our Meeting & Workshop. In both buildings (INB and LMS), accessible and gender-neutral toilets can be found on the Ground Floor. 
			<br>
			All lecture halls of the Meeting & Workshop have room to accommodate audiences with mobility constraints. 
			<br>
			<br>
			Lecture rooms INB0114 and LMS0005 are fully step-free, located on the Ground Floor. Lecture room INB1103 is easily accessible via a close-by  (main) lift of the building, but can also be reached from a second lift located near the Siemens facilities within INB.
			<br>
			<br>
			Public pathways between Lincoln Central Train Station, the Brayford Campus, the accommodation (Holiday Inn Express) and the Cosy Club have access ramps and controlled pedestrian crossings for step-free and safe locomotion. 
			
			<h2>Travel</h2>
			The Brayford Campus is located at the heart of the historic city of Lincoln, UK. The Campus is a 5min walk from the Lincoln Central Train Station. For participants intending to come by train, there are regular connections to major cities such as Nottingham, Leeds, Sheffield and London (from Kings Cross/St Pancras station). Participants travelling by bus should find regular connections to nearby major cities such as Nottingham.
			<br>
			<br>
			If you are travelling from mainland Europe, taking the Eurostar to London and then continuing by train to Lincoln might be a viable option. For those flying, the (geographically) closest airport is the East Midlands Airport (EMA), though people travelling to/from Lincoln often use larger hubs such as the airports in Manchester (MAN), Birmingham (BHX), and London (Stansted (STN), City (LCY), Heathrow (LHR), Luton (LTN), or Gatwick (LGW)). 
			<br>
			(In case our/your funding permits, attendees are strongly encouraged to use green(er) means of transportation, such as trains.)
