Prior to the [YGGT XI](https://www.uni-muenster.de/GGT/YGGT/), a mini-workshop about reflection groups was co-hosted by Magdeburg and Paris, organised by [Marco Lotz](https://www.geometry.ovgu.de/home/Members/Marco+Lotz.html) and [Anna Michael](https://www.geometry.ovgu.de/home/Members/Anna+Michael.html) in Germany and by [Sami Douba](https://www.ihes.fr/~/douba/) and [Rachel Skipper](https://sites.google.com/view/skippermath) in France. 

[Indira Chatterji](https://chatterj.perso.math.cnrs.fr/), [Petra Schwer](https://www.geometry.ovgu.de/schwer-path-16,30.html) and I served in the scientific committee and helped coordinate the workshop.
