Under the [Grant Scheme 9](https://www.lms.ac.uk/grants/celebrating-new-appointments-scheme-9) ("Celebrating New Appointments") of the [London Mathematical Society](https://www.lms.ac.uk/), I will be hosting a 2-day workshop entitled 'Trending Aspects in Group Cohomology' in Lincoln, UK.

The event will be held **2-3 July 2024** in the _Isaac Newton Building_ on the Brayford Campus of the [University of Lincoln](https://www.lincoln.ac.uk/). 
Invited speakers of the workshop are [Ilaria Castellano](https://sites.google.com/view/ilariacastellano/home) (Bielefeld), [Dawid Kielak](https://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/kielak/) (Oxford), and [Brita Nucinkis](https://www.ma.rhul.ac.uk/~uxah002/) (London), and there will be the opportunity for contributed talks.

Further information about the workshop can be found on the [homepage](/files/cna/) of the event.
