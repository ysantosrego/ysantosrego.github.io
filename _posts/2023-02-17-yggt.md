I organised, together with [Giles Gardam](https://www.gilesgardam.com/), [Kasia Jankiewicz](https://people.ucsc.edu/~kjankiew/), and [Bakul Sathaye](https://sites.google.com/view/sathaye/home), the eleventh edition of the  'Young Geometric Group Theory' conference series. The [YGGT XI](https://www.uni-muenster.de/GGT/YGGT/) took place from 13 to 17 February 2023 in Münster, Germany. We hosted over 150 participants from 16 countries. (Thanks everyone for joining!!) 

Our grants (from the [SPP 2026](https://www.spp2026.de/), the [Excellence Cluster](https://www.uni-muenster.de/MathematicsMuenster/de/) in Münster, the [GRK 2297](https://www.mathcore.ovgu.de/) in Magdeburg and the US american [NSF](https://www.nsf.gov/)) covered most of the costs.
