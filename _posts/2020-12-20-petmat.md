This year I was invited to share a few words about my academic path so far and the importance and meaning of the [PETMAT Program](https://mat.unb.br/pet/) of the University of Brasília. The (online) event was part of an event celebrating the 25 Years of the PETMAT/UnB, organised by [Luciana Ávila Rodrigues](https://mat.unb.br/index.php/pessoas/docentes/42-luciana-avila-rodrigues) and the current students of the PETMAT. 

Luciana and her students published a book ([open access](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rxrDdKJpdbS8KzID08mPpmBr6UdnJ77y/view)) about the history of this successful program, and a brief version of my testimony was published there ([p. 203; in Portuguese](https://issuu.com/lfeditorial/docs/25_anos_do_petmat_digital)).
