This year I was invited to share a few words about my academic path so far and the importance and meaning of the [PETMAT Programme](https://mat.unb.br/pet/) of the University of Brasília. The (online) event was part of a series celebrating the 25 Years of the PETMAT/UnB, organised by [Luciana Ávila Rodrigues](https://mat.unb.br/index.php/pessoas/docentes/42-luciana-avila-rodrigues) and the current students of the PETMAT. 

Luciana and her students published a book ([<img src="/images/OA-logo.svg" decoding="async" width="10" height="16" class="mw-file-element" srcset="/images/OA-logo.svg 1.5x, /images/OA-logo.svg 2x" data-file-width="640" data-file-height="1000"/>open access](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rxrDdKJpdbS8KzID08mPpmBr6UdnJ77y/view)) about the history of this successful programme, and a brief version of my testimony was published there ([p. 203; in Portuguese](https://issuu.com/lfeditorial/docs/25_anos_do_petmat_digital)).
