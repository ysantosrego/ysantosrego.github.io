I gave a talk at the Oberwolfach Workshop '[Cohomological and metric properties of groups of homeomorphism of \\(\mathbb{R}\\)](https://www.mfo.de/occasion/1823b/www_view)', which took place 3-9 June 2018. 

I also served as the [Reporter](https://publications.mfo.de/handle/mfo/3648) for the event, and helped collecting open problems posed at the workshop.
