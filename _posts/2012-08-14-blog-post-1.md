Together with [Benjamin Br√ºck](https://www.uni-muenster.de/Logik/Brueck/) and [Eduard Schesler](https://eduardschesler.de/) I organised the Block Seminar on [Arithmetic groups and rigidity](https://www.spp2026.de/activities/detail/activity/seminar-arithmetic-groups-and-rigidity), which took place in Bielefeld. 

The event was funded by a grant we got from the DFG (German Research Foundation) through the [SPP2026](https://www.spp2026.de/). 

In the seminar, [Alastair Litterick](https://www.essex.ac.uk/people/LITTE00606/Alastair-Litterick) and I gave a pair of lectures about Margulis Superrigidity. Our notes can be found [here](https://www.math.uni-bielefeld.de/agbux/public/arithmeticgroups2018/Superrigidity_1_and_2.pdf).
