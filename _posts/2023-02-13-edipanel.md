For the [YGGT XI](https://www.uni-muenster.de/GGT/YGGT/), colleagues from the organising and scientific committees appointed me as a [Panelist](https://www.uni-muenster.de/GGT/YGGT/Program.html#Panels) for the 'Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion (EDI) Panel', together with [Indira Chatterji](https://chatterj.perso.math.cnrs.fr/index.html), [Alexandra Edletzberger](https://at.linkedin.com/in/alexandraedletzberger), and [Genevieve Walsh](https://gwalsh01.pages.tufts.edu/). 

The panel was held on the evening of the first day of the conference, and I led the (sub)discussion about decolonisation of maths.
