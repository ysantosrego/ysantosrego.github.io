During the [Annual Colloquium 2022](https://www.mathcore.ovgu.de/index.php?show=events&event=2022-05-18-annual-colloquium) of the MathCoRe, I co-organised a special session about 'Mathematics, Geopolitics and Society', jointly with (and moderated by) [Barbara Witter](https://www.ga.ovgu.de/en/Contact/Barbara+Witter.html). 

This thematic session included statements about 'how free' science is in the home countries of some MathCoRe fellows, and discussions about how to build bridges for mathematicians from areas under geopolitical conflicts and about the overall responsibility of mathematical research in the development of potentially harmful technology.
