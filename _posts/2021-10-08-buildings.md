After a forced one-year break due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the annual Buildings Conference took place again in [Magdeburg, 2021](https://www.geometry.ovgu.de/buildings2021.html), in hybrid format. I organised it jointly with [Isobel Davies](http://www.isobeldavies.co.uk/), [Anna Michael](https://www.geometry.ovgu.de/home/Members/Anna+Michael.html) and [Petra Schwer](https://www.geometry.ovgu.de/schwer-path-16,30.html).
