I organised the last meeting of the 'Thompson community', namely the [GoTh Workshop: Groups of Thompson and their relatives](https://trr358.math.uni-bielefeld.de/workshops/view/146), jointly with [Kai-Uwe Bux](https://www.math.uni-bielefeld.de/~bux/pg_e01.html), [Ilaria Castellano](https://sites.google.com/view/ilariacastellano/home) and [Jos√© Pedro Quintanilha](https://www.mathi.uni-heidelberg.de/~jquintanilha/). 

The event took place in September 2023 in Magdeburg, Germany, gathering over 50 participants among long-time experts, newcomers, and enthusiasts from all around the globe.
